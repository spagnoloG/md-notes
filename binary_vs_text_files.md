# Binary vs text files

### Binary vs text files comparisson

- read this awesome article https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-cpp-text-file-and-binary-file/
- Basically normal text files take more space than binary files, becouse you need to convert integer representation of number into chars. In binary file
  format, the raw binary data is dumped into file. --> that results in much smaller file size
